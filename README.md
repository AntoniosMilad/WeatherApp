Make an app for showing weather according to the user current location

Make the UI simple and neat as much as possible
- Your current location city will be shown at the top of the page.
- Below the city list 3 days weather.
- If any item clicked you can write a note to it and save it locally.
- User can review all his previous notes and delete any.
- You can integrate with any weather API provider free plan 
Example: https://openweathermap.org/current or https://www.weatherapi.com/
or any other provider you find easy and simple
